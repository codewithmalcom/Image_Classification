## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Dhruv, the creator of this project. The goal of this repository is to provide a robust solution for image classification tasks. By leveraging the strengths of both C++ and Python, we can create an efficient system that processes images and recognizes patterns effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core engine of the project, responsible for heavy computations and performance optimization.
- **Python**: Used primarily for preprocessing images before they are fed into the C++ engine.
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing tasks.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations in Python.
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch: Depending on the model used for machine learning.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Classifies images into various categories.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares images for analysis.
- **Backpropagation**: Implements backpropagation for training neural networks.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Uses convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- **Max Pooling**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving important features.
- **Fully Convolutional Networks**: Enables pixel-wise classification for images.
- **Custom Filters**: Apply various filters for image enhancement.
- **Bias Adjustment**: Adjusts bias in the model to improve accuracy.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codewithmalcom/Image_Classification.git
   cd Image_Classification
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   For Python, you can install the necessary libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Compile C++ code**:
   Navigate to the C++ directory and compile the code:
   ```bash
   cd cpp
   g++ -o image_classifier main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the project**:
   After compiling, you can run the C++ engine with the command:
   ```bash
   ./image_classifier
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using it for image classification. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to classify an image:

1. **Prepare your images**: Place your images in the `images` folder.
2. **Run the preprocessing script**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. **Execute the classification**:
   ```bash
   ./image_classifier
   ```

The output will show the predicted classes for each image.
